Grail42 is a master project that links together the state of the subprojects 
listed below.

Grail42 Core
------------

At present the project just provides a few tools that simplify faux console
applications on Android and Google Native Client.  The example Visual Studio 
2010 project that these tools have been tested with is located in the sibling
project Grail42 Templates (see the Grail42 project referenced above).

Grail42 Templates
-----------------

This subproject currently contains the example code projects listed below and 
in the near future a Python script will be added to clone projects so that the
examples can be easily used as templates for new projects.

Hello World Console

  Demonstrates targeting the Android NDK, the Chrome Native Client SDK, and the 
  Windows SDK all from the same Visual Studio 2010 project.  Both 32-bit and 
  64-bit platforms are supported for Windows and Chrome Native Client (NaCl).
  
  Also demonstrates creating a faux console app for Android that allows the apps 
  stdout to be easily emitted in a Windows command prompt via the batch file 
  %grail42_core_cmd%\android\faux_console\run_app.cmd supplied by the Grail42 
  Core sibling project (see the Grail42 project referenced above).
  
  The NaCl platform is configured by default to run from the standalone 
  commandline tool sel_ldr*.exe rather than from Chrome to provide a consistent 
  console experience.  When run in Chrome, the project demonstrates doing so 
  as a faux console app that allows the plug-ins stdout to be easily emitted 
  in a Windows command prompt via the batch file that also starts and stops 
  the necessary simple web server.  The batch file is supplied by the Grail42 
  Core project at %grail42_core_cmd%\nacl\faux_console\run_nexe_in_chrome.cmd 
  and %grail42_core_cmd%\nacl\run_nexe_standalone.cmd providesa convienence 
  batch file o run the plug-in standalone in sel_ldr*.exe
